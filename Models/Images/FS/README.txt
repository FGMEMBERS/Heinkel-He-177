The Heinkel He 177 Greif (Griffin) was a long-range twin engined bomber of the Luftwaffe. 
The troubled aircraft was the only heavy bomber built in large numbers by Germany during World War II.

Perhaps no other aircraft of the German Luftwaffe was so potentially useful, but so troublesome as the Heinkel He-177 Greif. 
The Greif was detested by its crews, and by its mechanics. It is a fine example of the unrealized possibilities of the German Air Arm in World WarII.

 The He177 only made it to production through dogged courage and perseverance, and those two factors were the only thing that allowed it to reach large production numbers. 
In defense of the aircraft however, it could be said that all its troubles originated from a (absolutely asinine) 1938 requirement for a proposed heavy bomber/anti-shipping aircraft, that should also be capable of dive-bombing! So, the main problem of the He-177 was created: In an effort to reduce drag, the engineers decided that they would use coupled engines. 
(basically four engines, stuck together into two nacelles) These coupled engines would enter record books as being the most fire-prone engines in normal cruising flight. 
Out of the eight prototypes, six crashed. 
And of the 35 pre-production A-0s, (built for the most part by Arado Handelsgesellschaft, Warnemunde) a large number had to be written off due to take-off swings or in-flight fires. 
Arado built 130 A-1s, followed by 170 Heinkel built A-3s, and 826 A-5s, which had repositioned engines and a longer fuselage. 
About 700 Greifs served on the Eastern Front, many of these having 50mm and 75mm guns for tank-busting duties. 
A few even (nervously) bombed England in 400mph shallow dives, without any proper aiming for their bombs. The aircraft proved so bothersome that Goering had to forbid Heinkel to pester him any more with plans to use four separate engines! 
But Heinkel secretly flew the He277 with four 1-750hp DB 603A at Vienna, as the first of a major production programme. 
The almost completly redesigned He274 was a high-altitude bomber developed at the Farman factory at Suresnes, with four 1,850hp engines, a 145ft wing and twin fins. 
After the liberation, it was readied for flight, and flown at Orleans-Bricy. 
Perhaps the scariest fact about the He177 was the fact that one was secretely being readied in Czechoslovakia to carry the planned German Atomic bomb. 
It is quite possible that, if it weren't for a few brave Norwegian saboteurs, Adolf Hitler would have had a prepared Atomic bomb towards the war's end.

3. [ About the installation ]

 The airframe must copy the \He177 Greif folder as it is in the Aircraft folder of FS2002 or FS2004. 

     \FS2002(FS2004)
        -----\Aircraft
          ---------\He177 Greif
 

Please copy all files in the \gauges folder onto the gauge in the Gauges folder of FS2002 or FS2004. 
 A general gauge is saved for the gauge bundled this time. 
 The Gauges of 737-400, KingAir and GPS are not bundled. 
 Please setup it by yourself.

4. [ About the operations ]

   Shift+"E" = Under Exit Door Open/Shut

  ................................
  !! A special key operation !!
  ................................

  (Shift+"E")+"2" =  Bomb Bay Door Open/Shut

    Shift and "E" are pushed at the same time.  afterwards, please push "2". 
    "2" Key is "2" of the main keyboard.
    It doesn't move by "2" of ten keys.

 ************************************************************
 * for special key operation,                               *
 * It is likely not to operate according to a set method of *
 * your FS or the state of other Add-on tool.               *

 All aircraft that I made are free software. 
 The reprint and the repaint may go freely. 
 However, please defend the following conditions. 

     1.The change in contents of this file is prohibited. 
         (Please distribute it like the Zip file of the current state when distributing it. )
     2.Please neither reverse-assembly nor never remodel(convert) it of the aircraft model. 
     3.Please don't bundle my airframe(MDL file) in the package of your works when you open the repaint to the public. 
         (Please open only the texture to the public. )
     4.Don't use DXT format for making texture.
       Please make it by the format that everyone can change. 
       It is necessary to be able to read and change with usual drawing software. 
     5.It is prohibited to bundle and to open a new panel to the public to my aircraft model. 
         (Please open only the panel to the public. 
          It is included in this file, and remodeling the panel that uses the panel background and the change in the panel background are prohibited. )
     6.I maintain the copyright of the aircraft model and the panel background. 
     7.The copyright of the gauge belongs to the author. 

---------------------------------------------------------
6. [ About the directions point in FS2004 and FSX]

This aircraft model is made by using FSDS Ver2.24. 
Therefore, it is possible to play basically in FS2004(FS9) and FSX(FS10). 
However........!!
In FS2004.
For a wide large-scale aircraft, the distortion is caused and the phenomenon of the aerofoil tip's disappearing happens in the spot shooting mode. 
If this phenomenon happens, Please switch to the spot shooting mode by using other small aircraft. 
Afterwards, if this aircraft is selected, it is normally displayed. 

And........
In FSX.
Because gauges do not correspond to FSX, the gauges in the cockpit are not displayed. 
Please you looks for a suitable gauges and setup Panel.cfg by yourself.
Sorry...............
