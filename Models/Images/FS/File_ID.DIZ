FS2002/FS2004 Heinkel He-177 A-5/R5. Greif.
This was a long-range twin engined bomber of the Luftwaffe. 
The troubled aircraft was the only heavy bomber built in large numbers by Germany during World War II.
Perhaps no other aircraft of the German Luftwaffe was so potentially useful, but so troublesome as the Heinkel He-177 Greif.
